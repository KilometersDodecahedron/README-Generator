***

## Description
This program is designed to take in user input via the Command Line Interface (CLI) in order to generate a properly formatted "README" file.

***

## Setup
Since it is accessed via the CLI, the files must first be downloaded onto your computer.

**Note**: This program requires Node.js to run. Downlaod Node.js from [This Website](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you haven't already.

Once Node.js is installed and the files for this program have been downloaded, navigate to the main parent directory via the CLI.

This program uses the Inquirer Node Module, so before you can start using the Generator, you'll need to run the following line in your CLI:

![npm init](./Screenshots/1npminit.png)
![npm i inquirer](./Screenshots/2npmiinquirer.png)

You should then have a folder with the following contents:

You are now free to use the README Generator!
